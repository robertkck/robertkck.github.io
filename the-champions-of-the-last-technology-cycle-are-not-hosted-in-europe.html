<p>In the 19th and early 20th centuries Europe hosted most of the world leaders in the disruptive technologies of that time, such as manufacturers of railways and trains, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, electrical appliances and cars. In 2016, there were only seven EU companies among the 50 largest in the world, and the average year of their incorporation was 1913 (compared to 1943 in the US and 1964 in the rest of the world). The five largest companies in the world are all US companies, and four of them are IT companies formed after 1975.</p>
