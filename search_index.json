["businessmodel.html", "Chapter 1 Europe needs a new business model Developed countries lose their unique position on global markets Economic complexity Emerging economies move up the value chain – sometimes outcompeting incumbents The champions of the last technology cycle are not hosted in Europe", " Chapter 1 Europe needs a new business model In this Chapter we argue that Europe’s growth model of exporting more of the same products to the rest of the world is coming under pressure due to increasing competition from emerging and transition countries (which is amplifying the effect that the market for the products that Europe is good at exporting is growing more slowly than in the past). At the same time, Europe was not able to build an advantage in disruptive technology fields. Developed countries lose their unique position on global markets For many years the European Union’s growth model has been to fnd new markets for the products and services it is able to produce cheaper and better than most other countries. Tis model is under pressure. Te number of under-exploited markets is shrinking, while new competitors emerge quickly, challenging the comparative advantage of the EU even in higher value added goods and services. To secure growth and jobs in Europe, it is likely to be necessary to move to a new growth model built on developing emerging sectors with high value added. But in which sectors can Europe grow, and what economic policies would work? Economic complexity As emerging and transition countries moved up the value chain. There has been a notable convergence in the complexity of products exported by western and eastern countries. The Economic Complexity Indicator (ECI) developed by Harvard’s Center for International Development1 ranks how diversifed and complex countries’ export baskets are based on their diversity (how many different products each country can produce) and the ubiquity of those products (the number of countries able to make those products2). For almost all of the more than 100 ranked countries the indicator is between -2.5 and +2.5. In 2014, the ECI score for the United States was 1.36 and 1.10 for China. For EU countries3 it ranges from 0.22 for Greece and 1.92 for Germany. Te most striking observation is the rapid increase in the complexity of Chinese exports. While ranked below Bulgaria in 2000, China had surpassed Denmark and Belgium by 2014. Over the same period, the US and major EU economies gradually lost some of their advantage as new players – including from central and eastern Europe – started to export products that were previously only exported by the most-developed countries. This signals that incumbent exporters face increasing competitive pressure.

With China strongly specialising in exporting electric machinery, the share of machinery exports in German and US exports fell significantly. In the future, the same fate might await the global vehicles market, as China already today produces 25 million vehicles – mainly for its domestic market. This could have dramatic consequences, given the importance of the vehicles industry for countries like Germany – where vehicles are responsible for one fifth of the export. The champions of the last technology cycle are not hosted in Europe Figure 1.2: Caption In the 19th and early 20th centuries Europe hosted most of the world leaders in the disruptive technologies of that time, such as manufacturers of railways and trains, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, electrical appliances and cars. In 2016, there were only seven EU companies among the 50 largest in the world, and the average year of their incorporation was 1913 (compared to 1943 in the US and 1964 in the rest of the world). The five largest companies in the world are all US companies, and four of them are IT companies formed after 1975. http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/rankings/↩ Consequently, the ECI is a relative indicator. Tat is, it might go down even if the country does not change its export basket, as soon as other countries start to also export some of those products↩ The rankings do not cover Cyprus, Luxembourg and Malta.↩ "],
["low-carbon-is-promising.html", "Chapter 2 Low carbon is promising Low carbon technology in innovation and export Global investment scenario", " Chapter 2 Low carbon is promising In this part we argue that low carbon technologies such as electric vehicles, wind motors, batteries and solar PV have disproportionate growth potential. They are seeing disruptive innovation (2.1) and strongly increased investment which is likely to continue (2.2). Consequently, we identify the low-carbon technology sector as promising Low carbon technology in innovation and export --> Figure 2.1: Caption The export of electric vehicles, wind motors, batteries and solar PV has been growing faster than the export of other products. So their share in global exports is increasing. At the same time, these technologies also experienced faster technological development than other technologies – indicating higher returns to innovation. Global investment scenario Figure 2.2: Caption The political momentum to combat climate change was reconfrmed and reinforced in 2015, when for the frst time all countries agreed in the Paris Agreement to limit carbon emissions and to aim for carbon neutrality in the second half of the century. Together with growing electricity demand in emerging countries, the market for low-carbon energy will continue to increase. Investments in 2015 already exceed prediction "],
["revealed-strength.html", "Chapter 3 Revealed Strength Revealed strength in exports and technology", " Chapter 3 Revealed Strength In this Chapter we argue that, in a market economy environment, current strength is a good predictor of future strength in producing and exporting certain products. Current strength indicates that crucial factors are available and their prices are appropriate, that knowledge and a network of suppliers are established and that the regulatory environment is conducive. While having a comparative advantage in a product provides some indication that a sector might grow in a country, the absence of a revealed comparative advantage does not imply that a country is unable to develop new strengths in the future. One of the building blocks of future comparative advantage – especially in new technologies – is innovation. Tus, countries that focus their patenting activity on specifc technologies are likely to also have a comparative advantage in exporting the corresponding products. Revealed strength in exports and technology --> We frst investigate which countries are already specialised in our four low-carbon technologies in term of trade and innovation. We focus on two indicators of relative strength Revealed comparative advantage (RCA) assumes that market-based economies reveal their underlying comparative advantages by exporting those goods and services in which they are comparatively good Thereby, the revealed technology advantage (RTA) is the equivalent to the revealed comparative advantage in terms of patenting.

["potential.html", "Chapter 4 Potential Technological proximity Potential strength in technology", " Chapter 4 Potential In this chapter, we want to determine which countries might have some of the prerequisites for developing an advantage in the four technologies of interest. We build on the fact that countries fnd it easier to innovate in technologies that are related to technologies they are already good at4. As a measure of technology proximity, we use the relative frequency with which two technology classes (in fact technology codes) appear as part of the same patent. We then analyse which countries are good at patenting the technologies we identifed as being ‘nearby’ our four low-carbon technologies. Technological proximity The heatmap shows the strength of the relationship between two technologies. The connection between two technologies is high if there are many patents classified to belong to both. High relative co-occurence on a patent leads to strong relatedness in red. Blue shows technology classes that are not related. The heatmap illustrates that IPC codes are more likely to concur with IPC codes that are classifed close to them (ie that share the same frst two digits), as the areas of high concurrence are close to the main diagonal. To give one example, to establish Slovakia’s potential for wind turbine innovation, we look at the two most-related technologies, namely ‘machines or engines for liquids’ and ‘control or regulation of electric motors’. We fnd that the potential RTA of Slovakia for wind turbines is rather high, because it is already specialised in the two nearby technologies. In fact, Slovakia is also already specialised in wind turbines. Potential strength in technology In general we fnd that countries that specialise in nearby technologies are already also specialised in the low-carbon technology of interest – somewhat validating our approach. The interesting cases are, however, those countries that are good at innovating in nearby technologies, but which have not yet developed a specialisation in the technology of interest. For example, Austria developed a technology advantage in electric propulsion and Ireland in wind turbines↩ "],
["clusters-matter.html", "Chapter 5 Clusters matter Innovation in technologies is clustered in only a few regions", " Chapter 5 Clusters matter Innovative activity is not evenly distributed within countries. It largely follows the concentration of industrial activity. Consequently, patent data is helpful data in identifying regional industrial strengths (clusters). The advantage over other types of data is that patent data is available for concrete locations (the address of the applicant), with a narrowly categorised technology description (the IPC code). Innovation in technologies is clustered in only a few regions Innovation in individual technologies is typically clustered in only a few regions. Regional clusters of patenting activity in certain technology areas are not just a result of clustered industrial activity. They also point to innovation spillovers and the most fascinating example being Silicon Valley. The four technologies benefit from different types of knowledge-spillovers. We can observe important technological clusters for batteries and solar panels, while this is less evident for electric vehicles and wind turbines. Solar panels represent the technology with the highest geographical concentration of citations: the gap between the interval 0-200 kilometres and the others is indeed very important. At the same time, solar PV and electric vehicles are more relying on related technologies while batteries and wind turbines mostly cite patents within the same technological class. "],
["conclusion.html", "Conclusion", " Conclusion Europe’s business model of selling more of the same in new markets is reaching its limits as the pace at which new markets emerge slows, while new competitors that sell the same products emerge quickly. One strategy to restore economic growth in Europe would be to embark on exporting new products that promise higher value added and growing markets. One such area could be low-carbon technologies. In the framework of global decarbonisation and the desire to reduce resource consumption, the market for low-carbon technologies has been growing fast – and is likely to continue to do so. In terms of European potential we assessed different criteria: Strength of current exports: Strong exports are a powerful signal that a country is (relatively) better at producing certain goods or services. Different EU countries already have comparative advantages in a number of low-carbon technologies. For example Denmark, Germany and Spain are major exporters of wind turbines. Strength of current innovation: Other EU countries might have the potential to develop comparative advantages based on their specialisation in innovation in these new f elds. For example, Germany is already strong in patenting electric vehicle technology and might turn this into a comparative advantage Innovation strength in nearby technologies: The Czech Republic and the UK have so far not excelled in patenting and exporting wind turbines – but their specialisation in innovation in nearby technologies suggests that some of the technological prerequisites for strengthening innovation in wind technology and ultimately boosting exports are present. Although modest in absolute terms, some central and east European countries exhibit specialisation in technologies related to electric vehicles and photovoltaic cells. Regional clusters: Finally we fnd that – while only Belgium is good at exporting batteries and no EU country is good at inventing batteries – several regional clusters exist that are generating signifcant battery technology patents. These clusters might be the nuclei of future growth. We can therefore conclude that the EU has potential, but that one-size-fts-all policies would ignore the complexity of the task of supporting the EU economy to gain a competitive edge in new products and services that will form the basis for future growth and jobs. To identify policies to foster future competitiveness we suggest a four-step flter (below), with each step, as much as possible, based on transparent criteria. Tis would also enable ex-post evaluation – which in the medium term allows the policy toolbox to be improved. Four-step filter "],
