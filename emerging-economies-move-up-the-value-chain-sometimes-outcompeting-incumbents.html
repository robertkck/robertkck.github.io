<h2>Emerging economies move up the value chain – sometimes outcompeting incumbents</h2>
<!-- The transformation of China into an economy that can compete with incumbent -->
<!-- exporters is impressively illustrated by the change in its export basket. While in 1990, electric machinery already made up 10 percent of German and 12 percent of US exports, it only -->
<!-- accounted for 6 percent of Chinese exports. By 2015, electric machinery had become the -->
<!-- backbone of Chinese exports, accounting for a quarter of the country’s huge foreign sales. -->
<!-- At the same time the US – after a surge around the year 2000 – dramatically shifted its export -->
<!-- focus away from electric machinery to other products. -->
<!-- Europe’s growth for a long time rested on fnding new markets for its incumbent export -->
<!-- industry. German car exports are a striking example of this development. The share of road -->
<!-- vehicles in German gross exports grew from 12 percent in 1965 to 15 percent in 2010 and to -->
<!-- 18 percent in 2015. German export-based industry is thus extremely vulnerable to just one -->
<!-- single product. So far, China (and other emerging countries) remains a sleeping dragon. But if China – which has developed a signifcant car industry for the massive domestic market -->
<!-- (25 million cars per year^[According to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, 25 million vehicles were sold in China in 2015, of -->
<!-- which 41 percent were a Chinese brand: http://www.caam.org.cn/AutomotivesStatistics/20160120/1305184264.html.]) – manages to increase the share of cars in its export basket from -->
<!-- the current 3 percent at the same pace as it did for electric machinery, the German economy -->
<!-- would come under massive pressure. -->

<p>This can be illustrated for electric machinery exports which in 2000 accounted for 20% of US and 15% of German exports. With China strongly specialising in exporting electric machinery, the share of machinery exports in German and US exports fell significantly. In the future, the same fate might await the global vehicles market, as China already today produces 25 million vehicles – mainly for its domestic market. This could have dramatic consequences, given the importance of the vehicles industry for countries like Germany – where vehicles are responsible for one fifth of the export.</p>
