Welcome to the Low Carbon Growth Project Documentation!
=============================================

The documentation aims to provide a comprehensive overview of
  1. the project structure by means of a :ref:`flow`
  2. all defined functions and
  3. related jupyter notebooks and (R, Stata, etc) scripts

While all .py files are automatically parsed for the documentation, other
scripts have to be manually added.

Contents:

   jupyter
   ../../pRCA/pRCA.ipynb
